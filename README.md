For this assignment, I created my portfolio using CSS
along with bootstrap features. I used the grid feature of 
bootstrap to align all my items on my pages properly. I then 
used a form and cards from bootstrap to create my contact page.
The responsive images can be found on the portfolio page, also
done through bootstrap.The navbar is fully responsive across all
the pages.# 02HW-ResponsivePortfolio
